# HomeLLC_Assignment_2023
**Study of key factors that influence US home prices nationally**
In this project, we are trying to identify the major variables affecting US house values during the previous 20 years, we will use data-driven insight in this study. Our aim is to construct a complete model that clarifies the complex relationship between many factors and home prices by utilizing both publicly available data and cutting-edge data science approaches.


# Utilized libraries and tools:
Programming Languages: Python
Data Analysis Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks

# Data Collection
The following variables are chosen for the study-
***Data download from: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/***
-Unemployment Rate
-Median Household Income
-Interest Rates
-Number of new houses supplied
-Housing subsidies
***Data Download from : https://fred.stlouisfed.org/***
-Percentage of population above 65


# Observation :As most variable increase with time. So, it is expected that they will have high correlation. So, instead of depending upon the linear model, we can directly study the impact of variables on the home price index using the scatter plots.

***A few variables that could have been studied are below.***

-Construction Prices
-CPI
-Number of new houses supplied
-Working Population
-Urban Population
-Percentage of population above 65
-Number of Households
-Marriage Rate
-Land availability
-Number of active listings
